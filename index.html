                Hi, I'm Dayna (she/her). 
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm a programmer, manager, organizer, baker, reader, crocheter, and gamer looking to make a difference in Canada's video game industry. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe in open, honest communication and the incredible power of happy and empowered developers. I love working to enable a team to bring their project from pre-production to release and beyond to continuous development by proactively removing obstacles, streamlining workflows, and keeping things organized.

              <p>
                I did my undergraduate at the University of Alberta, where I also received a <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/media-technology-studies/programs/computer-game-development/index.html">Certificate in Computer Game Development</a>. To get this certificate, I took six game-focused courses. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of these courses explored game theory and history, teaching us to root out bad design decisions while playtesting and critically assessing published games and prototypes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Others gave us the opportunity to form into interdisciplinary teams and develop tabletop games, as well as mods and video games using engines including <a href="http://www.kodugamelab.com/">Kodu</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/quest">Quest</a>, <a href="https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Toolset">Aurora</a>, and <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The courses I took included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>CMPUT 250: Computers and Games</li>
                <li>CMPUT 350: Advanced Games Programming</li>
                <li>INT D 350: Game Design Principles and Practice</li>
                <li>EDIT 486: Interactive Media</li>
                <li>STS 350: Understanding Video Games</li>
                <li>INT D 450: Computers and Games</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Besides these excellent games courses, the highlights of my University career would include being the Vice President of the <a href="http://vgad.org">Video Game Art &amp; Design Club</a>, instructing a coding class of 30+ young girls with <a href="http://discovere.ualberta.ca/">DiscoverE</a>, and above all else, helping to found, manage, and grow the Edmonton <a href="https://alberta.campuslabs.ca/engage/event/41151">Game Discovery Exhibition</a>. 
              </p>

                GDX 2016 was an exhibition of indie games created with the intention of promoting game development in Alberta. The event lasted 2 days and had 1200 attendees, 15 panels, 6 speakers, 2 awards ceremonies, 5 tournaments, and 100+ game developers showcasing their work. I was in charge of the Social Media team. We spent months gathering information about the indie developers and their games, as well as the panelists and speakers so we could promote them on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. During the exhibition we interviewed all of the developers and posted updates to social media helping them to collect playtesters and funding for their games. Being a part of the creation and planning of this event was monumental for me. So many of the games we showcased have since been published and some of the developers have even spun up their own indie studios. I love that I was a part of that.

              <p>
                Since University I have been working at <a href="https://seriouslabs.com/">Serious Labs</a>, a tech company that develops virtual reality heavy machinery simulators aimed at reducing the risk of jobsite incidents through virtual training. Since starting at Serious, I have been part of the development of multiple <a href="https://seriouslabs.com/products/iti-vr-crane-simulator/">Crane simulators</a>, a <a href="https://seriouslabs.com/products/mewp-vr-simulator/">Scissor and Boom Lift simulator</a>, and a <a href="https://seriouslabs.com/products/universal-motion-base-simulator/">Forklift simulator</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started at Serious Labs as a Junior Programmer working with Unity and C# to update the original Crane simulator. About half a year into the job I had the opportunity to explore and demonstrate my organizational side, and was quickly partnered with a Lead Programmer for mentorship. Half a year later I was the Lead Programmer on the Forklift Project working alongside the Lead Designer, Lead Artist, and QA to help our Producer plan the project, wrangle the developers, organize the backlog, and triage the bugs. I was in my element. Solving programming problems on one monitor while dealing with interpersonal and organizational problems on the other. 
              </p>
              <p>
                When the Forklift simulator was successfully released, I was moved onto a small team with the goal of unifying the company's many simulators under one scoring system. I was made the team lead and told to use this time to experiment with different management and organizational methodologies. I was fortunate enough to be grouped with some of the most introspective and team-focused people I have ever met. They were all more than willing to be a part of these experiments. Over the next few months we introduced Scrum methodologies, transformed the way the company did retrospectives, and explored a <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/">Radically Candid</a> communication style. Our experiments resulted in such an efficient and happy team that the Production team used us as an example to develop an entirely new company structure and asked me to join their team.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a Producer, I started by leading the team developing the <a href="https://portal.seriouslabs.com/">Serious Care Portal</a>, and becoming the go-to Jira expert - helping to move the company over from Jira Server to Jira Cloud by reinventing all of our Workflows, Dashboards, Screens, and Custom Fields. When work ramped down on the Portal, I was moved onto an unannounced product where I am now actively managing the sprints, planning, and retrospection for an interdisciplinary team of 14 developers.
              </p>

                </h3>
                <p>Duality was my very first foray into Game Development. It is a mod for Neverwinter Nights that I developed alongside two other programmers, a writer, an artist, and a composer.</p>
                <p>In Duality, you play as a bereaved twin coming to terms with what has happened in order to escape the limbo-like state of her mind. You must overcome challenges in the presence of her shadow - a hostile image of the character herself.</p>
                <p>The game consists of several mirrored rooms containing creative and logical puzzles bearing themes of duality, with mirrors representing self-reflection.</p>
                <p>Duality was nominated for three categories in the BioWare-sponsored awards ceremony and won both "Excellence in Art and Design" and "Audio Achievement" awards.</p>
                <p>I worked as a level designer and programmer for this game.</p>

                  I was the project manager as well as a developer for this game. No Excuse For Monster Abuse was created as the capstone project to the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/interdisciplinary-studies/computer-game-development">Computer Game Development Certificate</a> at the University of Alberta. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I did all of the UI, most of the visual effects, and any programming that didn't fall under the category of <b>Players</b> or <b>Enemies</b>.
                </p>
                <p>This project was my first project management experience. I created internal deadlines with my team and ensured we were held to them.</p>

                <p>God Of Toys is the game my team created during my very first Game Jam. The theme was "What do we do now?". </p>
                <p>We created an abnormal toy creation game where the player is given haikus and other unhelpful advice as to what toys would sell best, and then has to make that toy.</p>

                <p>The artist for our game, No Excuse For Monster Abuse (see above) was greatly overworked.</p>
                <p>Our artist drew out one sideways facing sprite for each character, but she didn't have time to expand on that and create a running animation. To help her out, I learned to use GIMP and did some photo editing on her sprites to create these running animations.</p>

                <p>No Excuse For Monster Abuse is about students from a superhero school. I was determined to stay true to that theme as much as possible. The pause menu for our game is shown below. It was designed to look like a billboard advertising the superhero school. The hero being featured on the left is determined by which player pressed pause.</p>

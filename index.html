                Hi, I'm Dayna. I'm a web developer, game enthusiast, baker, artist, optimist, and creative writer. I recently got my bachelor's degree in Computing Science, and in the past 6 years of University, I have learned a <i>lot</i> about myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, when I enrolled at the University of Alberta I intended to major in Chemistry and minor in English. Six years ago I was a shy introvert with her nose in a book avoiding the public eye; now I've been the Vice President of the <a href="http://vgad.org">Video Game Art &amp; Design Club</a>, I instructed a coding class of 30+ young girls with <a href="http://discovere.ualberta.ca/">DiscoverE</a>, and I helped found, manage, and grow the Edmonton <a href="http://www.gdxedmonton.com/">Game Discovery Exhibition</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my fourth year at the University I was accepted into the Science Internship Program. By this point I had discovered that my favourite part of computing is the visual aspect - typing a couple lines of code and seeing the results magically appear on the screen. I applied to internships that focussed on the these aspects of programming, primarily game development and web development. I caught the eye of the hiring team at <a href="http://onlea.org">Onlea Corporation</a>, and they emailed me asking why I would apply for their web developer position without any javascript, css, or html experience. They warned me that they would be testing my knowledge in the area at the interview, and that I wouldn't be able to pass the tests without some level of experience. I told them that I had never used any web-based tools or languages, but that I am a fast learner and would study them before the interview and they decided to give me a chance. Less than a week later, I astonished them by passing all of their tests and they decided to offer me the job. My internship at Onlea involved a steep learning curve and an impressive display of adaptability and personal growth. I came out of it a skilled web developer with experience in a wide variety of front- and back-end tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout my University career, I worked towards the Computer Game Development Certificate. In completing the courses required for this, I have studied games, game theory, and game history; learned about a variety of game applications and mechanics; and developed numerous games under various levels of restraint and using a multitude of engines. For the capstone to this certificate I was the project manager and one of the developers of an interdisciplinary team of six. We brainstormed, designed, and developed a fully functional 2D couch co-op platforming game called <a href="https://vgad.org/portfolio/no-excuse-for-monster-abuse/">No Excuse for Monster Abuse</a>. In creating this game, I got to stretch my project management, programming, and UI design skills, as well as to discover and hone my image and audio editing skills. Working towards the Computer Game Development Certificate helped me discover a passion for games and game development. It also allowed me to develop my interpersonal skills, come out of my shell, and discover that game development allows my creative and logical sides to work together and produce magic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that I have graduated, I intend to pursue a career that will allow me to develop either for the web and/or for games. With Onlea and DiscoverE I got a brief taste of gamifying education and I am eager to explore the area further.
              </p>

                <p>As I said above, I was quite determined to keep up the superhero school theme in our game. The main menu is shown on a chalkboard in a classroom with all of the students seated at their desks. I didn't have any sprites of the characters facing away from the player, so I created these by colouring over the faces of the forward-facing sprites.</p>

                <p>I based our game logo on a No Excuse For Animal Abuse <a href="https://rlv.zcache.com/there_is_no_excuse_for_animal_abuse_magnet-rde61eebde1114b9b963f4108232a5c0e_x7js9_8byvr_324.jpg">pin</a> I found on the internet. We printed it out on pins and gave it to everyone who playtested our game.</p>
